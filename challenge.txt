One fine day, one task was there to retrieve, data of a particular employee according to user name, 
There was normal Ui for search option , where you need to enter the user id, after searching, it will display the details if the user exist,

So one user id with all details is there in back end,
i have write the dao and service classes with appropriate queries, 
but when ever i search the user id from ui , 
its not displaying the data, i stuck there it self, 
then after long experiment i found that that user id i entered in the ui contains extra one blank space,
 so i applied trim() at java code, then it works, so it always recommended to use trim(), when ever you are getting the request parameters.
